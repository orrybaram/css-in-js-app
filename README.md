- [rockey](https://github.com/tuchk4/rockey)
- [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
- [styletron](https://github.com/rtsao/styletron)
- and example with React inline styles

Each bundle is lazy initializing (so for better results update page before test to keep initialized only current bundle). Also
there are:

- Timers for rendering 4000 same components and 4000 different components with styles defined in JS.
- Checkbox to switch `primary` property
- Input to change text
- Links to source code of each bundle
